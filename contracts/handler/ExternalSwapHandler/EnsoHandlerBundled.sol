 * @title EnsoHandlerBundled

 * operations into a single transaction. This contract facilitates complex strategies that involve
 * multiple steps, such as swaps followed by transfers, by allowing them to be executed in one
 * transaction. This is particularly useful for optimizing gas costs and simplifying transaction management
 * for users. It includes functionalities for wrapping/unwrapping native tokens as part of these operations.
